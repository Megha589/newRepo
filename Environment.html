            <li>Earth faces a triple planetary emergency:</li>
            <ul type="circle">
                <li>the climate is heating up too quickly for people and nature to adapt;</li>
                <li>habitat loss and other pressures mean an estimated 1 million species are threatened with extinction;</li>
                <li>pollution continues to poison our air, land and water.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The way out of this dilemma is to transform our economies and societies to make them inclusive, fair and more<br> connected with nature.<b> We must shift from harming the planet to healing it.</b></li>
            <li>The good news is the solutions and the technology exist and are increasingly affordable.</li>

    <h1 align="center"><u>SAVE ENVIRONMENT </u></h1>
    <p>Our environment is our surrounding area and something that sustains us. It is the natural condition in which an organism, plant, or animal grows and prospers. Our environment shields us and helps us grow into individual beings. Saving our environment is vital for sustaining humanity because, without a clean environment, none of us will survive.</p>
    <p>The environment is our natural foundation, and we have to take care of it. Our environment plays a massive role in the kind of person we grow up to be. There are a lot of valid reasons for which we need to save our environment. Our environment has suffered significant threats in the last few decades. The ever increasing vehicles and pollution have transformed our environment into a mass of smoky mess. Enormous corruption has almost stripped it of fresh air.</p>

        <p>The organization uses a peaceful, creative approach in paving the way for a greener and more peaceful planet, by tackling the systems that threaten the existence of our environment. <br> Greenpeace India gets its funding from Indian donors (60%), Greenpeace International – Netherlands (38%), and around 1% from the Climate Works Foundation in the US.

          According to Greenpeace India, it tries to avoid influence by avoiding funding from governments, political parties, corporations, and various intergovernmental organizations. <br> This way, they can remain objective in protecting the environment.</p></center>
